# Chat-online-en-Ensamblador
This is a proyect make for my person and other 2 partners, we make a chat online in assembly with a maximum 3 persons writing at the same time.
The idea of have a online method is macking a py that load and upload the txt to firebase and with this the program read the txt and 
print the text for have a conversation, can change the color of the chat, make a account and the most interesting thing is that the msg need 
to be create in a format like "..;/.-.;/", it is importan because the estructure of the internal lector of morse code, change the text to a 
normal words, can see the txt for have a better idea.
Also the chat is using the mouse, and have space to click it and do some interaction, and when the write space is clicked the user have 2 spaces
to click "; or /" and the ". or -" can be used clicking the left or right buttom of the mouse, and delet a char is clicking the mid buttom
of the mouse.
Sorry if something is incomprehensible, i try to do my best learning english (:,3).
